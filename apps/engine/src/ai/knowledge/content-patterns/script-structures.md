## 🏗️ Core Structure Philosophy

### The 4-Part Framework

Every effective short-form video follows:

```
[HOOK] → [BUILD] → [PAYOFF] → [CTA/LOOP]
```

| Part | Purpose | Duration |
|------|---------|----------|
| Hook | Stop scroll, create curiosity | 1-3 sec |
| Build | Deliver value, maintain tension | 50-70% |
| Payoff | Satisfaction, revelation | 20-30% |
| CTA/Loop | Action or seamless restart | 1-3 sec |

## 📐 Structure Templates

### Template 1: The Listicle

**Best For**: Tips, education, quick wins

```
[HOOK] "3 things nobody tells you about [topic]..."

[ITEM 1] "First: [point]" 
[Brief explanation or example]

[ITEM 2] "Second: [point]"
[Brief explanation or example]

[ITEM 3] "Third - and this is the important one: [point]"
[Explanation with emphasis]

[CTA] "Save this for later" / "Follow for more"
```

**Pro Tip**: Make #3 the strongest point. Create progression.

---

### Template 2: The Story Arc

**Best For**: Personal experiences, entertainment, drama

```
[HOOK] "So there I was, [intriguing situation]..."

[SETUP] "It started when [context]..."

[RISING ACTION] "Then [escalation]..."
"I thought [assumption]..."

[CLIMAX] "But then [twist/revelation]..."

[RESOLUTION] "[Outcome/lesson]"

[LOOP/CTA] "[Connects to beginning OR calls for comment]"
```

**Pro Tip**: Front-load the most interesting detail as the hook.

---

### Template 3: The Problem-Solution

**Best For**: Tutorials, how-tos, productivity

```
[HOOK - PROBLEM] "If you struggle with [problem], watch this..."

[AGITATE] "[Why this problem is painful/costly]"

[SOLUTION TEASE] "Here's what actually works..."

[SOLUTION] "[Step-by-step or explanation]"
"[Demonstration or example]"

[RESULT] "[What this achieves]"

[CTA] "Try it and let me know if it works for you"
```

**Pro Tip**: Make the problem feel urgent before solving it.

---

### Template 4: The Hot Take

**Best For**: Commentary, opinions, engagement

```
[HOOK - BOLD CLAIM] "[Controversial statement]"

[EVIDENCE 1] "Here's why: [first reason]"

[EVIDENCE 2] "Also, [second reason]"

[PREEMPT OBJECTION] "Now, you might say [counter]... but [rebuttal]"

[SOLIDIFY] "[Restate position with conviction]"

[CTA] "Am I wrong? Tell me in the comments"
```

**Pro Tip**: Pick positions you can defend. Don't be controversial for shock value.

---

### Template 5: The Before-After

**Best For**: Transformations, tutorials, reviews

```
[HOOK - BEFORE] "[Negative starting point - relatable]"

[PAIN POINT] "[Why this state was problematic]"

[TRANSITION] "Then I discovered [solution]..."

[AFTER] "[Positive result with specifics]"

[HOW] "[Quick explanation of what changed]"

[CTA] "If you want to know more, follow me"
```

**Pro Tip**: Make the before genuinely relatable.

---

### Template 6: The Step-by-Step

**Best For**: Tutorials, DIY, processes

```
[HOOK] "Here's exactly how to [achieve result] in [timeframe]"

[STEP 1] "Step 1: [action]"
[Brief demo/explanation]

[STEP 2] "Step 2: [action]"
[Brief demo/explanation]

[STEP 3] "Step 3: [action]"
[Brief demo/explanation]

[RESULT] "[What you end up with]"

[CTA] "Save this and try it yourself"
```

**Pro Tip**: Keep steps actionable and specific.

---

### Template 7: The Myth Buster

**Best For**: Education, expertise, authority

```
[HOOK - MYTH] "Everyone thinks [common belief]..."

[TRUTH TEASE] "But that's actually wrong."

[REALITY] "Here's what's really happening: [truth]"

[WHY IT MATTERS] "[Implication of knowing this]"

[ACTION] "[What to do instead]"

[CTA] "Stop believing [myth] - follow for more truth"
```

**Pro Tip**: Choose myths your audience actually believes.

---

### Template 8: The Loop Design

**Best For**: Entertainment, rewatchability, TikTok algorithm

```
[HOOK - ENDING REFERENCE] "[Statement that makes sense at end]"

[BODY] "[Regular content]"

[BUILD] "[Progression toward revelation]"

[REVELATION] "[The thing that recontextualizes the beginning]"

[END/LOOP START] "[Seamlessly connects to first frame]"
```

**Pro Tip**: The loop should feel natural, not forced.

## ⏱️ Duration-Based Structures

### 15-Second Script

```
[1s] HOOK - Bold statement
[10s] ONE main point with support
[2s] Quick payoff
[2s] CTA or loop
```

### 30-Second Script

```
[2s] HOOK - Curiosity builder
[20s] 2-3 points with brief support
[5s] Payoff/conclusion
[3s] CTA or loop
```

### 60-Second Script

```
[3s] HOOK - Strong attention grab
[40s] Full story/list/tutorial
[12s] Payoff with depth
[5s] CTA + loop possibility
```

## 🎯 Platform-Specific Adjustments

## 🚫 Structure Anti-Patterns

### What Kills Videos

❌ Starting with "So..." or "Hey guys"
❌ Long introductions before value
❌ No clear payoff at end
❌ Multiple disconnected topics
❌ Rambling without structure
❌ Weak endings that fade out
❌ CTA before delivering value

---

## 💡 Advanced Techniques

### The Open Loop

Start with a mystery that closes at the end:
- Hook: "What I found shocked me..."
- Build: Content without revealing
- Payoff: The shocking reveal

### The Double Hook

Two hooks in opening seconds:
- Visual hook (pattern interrupt)
- Verbal hook (curiosity gap)

### The Nested Structure

List within a story:
- Story frame opens
- List delivers value
- Story frame closes
