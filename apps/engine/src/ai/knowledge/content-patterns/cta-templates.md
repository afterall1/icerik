## 📱 Platform-Specific CTA Strategies

### TikTok CTAs

TikTok users are skeptical of desperate CTAs. Use **indirect engagement**:

#### Comment Baits
```
"What would you do in this situation? 👇"
"Am I wrong about this? Let me know."
"Part 2 if this gets [X] likes"
"Drop a [emoji] if you agree"
"Fill in the blank: [prompt]..."
"The best comment gets a shoutout"
```

#### Soft Follow CTAs
```
"Follow for part 2"
"More [topic] content on my page"
"I post about [topic] every day"
[No CTA - let content speak]
```

#### Share Prompts
```
"Send this to that friend who..."
"Tag someone who needs to see this"
"Your [type] friend needs this"
```

---

### Instagram Reels CTAs

Reels favors **saves and shares**:

#### Save CTAs (Highest Value)
```
"Save this for later 📌"
"You'll want to come back to this"
"Bookmark this for when you need it"
"Screenshot this before you forget"
"Save and try this weekend"
```

#### Share CTAs
```
"Send this to someone who needs it"
"Tag a friend who does this"
"DM this to your [type of friend]"
"Share this with someone who..."
```

#### Soft Engagement
```
"Double tap if you relate"
"Comment your [related topic]"
"What's your experience with this?"
"Tell me in the comments..."
```

#### Story Bridge
```
"Tap my Story for the full breakdown"
"More details in my Stories"
"Swipe up on my Story for Part 2"
```

### YouTube Shorts CTAs

Shorts uniquely drives **subscriptions**:

#### Subscribe CTAs (Primary)
```
"Subscribe for more [topic]"
"Hit subscribe if you want part 2"
"If you want more like this, subscribe"
"Subscribe - I post [frequency]"
"Don't miss the next one - subscribe"
```

#### Channel Bridge
```
"Full video on my channel"
"Check my channel for the complete guide"
"Link to full breakdown in my bio"
"Extended version on my main channel"
```

#### Engagement
```
"Drop a 🔥 if you learned something"
"Comment what you want next"
"Like if this helped"
"Let me know your thoughts below"
```

## 🎨 Category-Specific CTAs

### Education/Tutorial
```
"Save this - you'll need it later"
"Bookmark for reference"
"Screenshot the steps"
"Follow for more tips"
```

### Entertainment
```
"Part 2? Let me know"
"Tag someone who'd react like this"
"Drop a [emoji] if you relate"
[Often no CTA - entertainment speaks]
```

### Product/Review
```
"Comment if you want the link"
"Would you try this?"
"Have you used [product]? Tell me"
"Save to remember for later"
```

### Story/Drama
```
"Part 2 coming tomorrow"
"What would you have done?"
"Follow for the ending"
"Comment for the update"
```

## 💡 Advanced CTA Techniques

### The Choice CTA
```
"Comment A if [option] or B if [other option]"
Creates engagement through simple decision.
```

### The Challenge CTA
```
"Try this and tag me in your results"
Creates user-generated content loop.
```

### The Tease CTA
```
"Part 2 is even crazier - make sure you're following"
Uses curiosity to drive follows.
```

### The FOMO CTA
```
"This only works for the next [X] days"
Creates urgency without being spammy.
```
