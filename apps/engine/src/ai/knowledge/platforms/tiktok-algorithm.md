## 🎯 Core Algorithm Principles

### The For You Page (FYP) Algorithm

TikTok's algorithm is a **recommendation engine** that evaluates content based on:

1. **User Interactions** (strongest signals)
2. **Video Information** (hashtags, sounds, captions)
3. **Device & Account Settings** (language, country, device type)

### Primary Ranking Signals (Priority Order)

| Signal | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Watch Time** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Total seconds spent watching |
| **Completion Rate** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | % of video watched (100%+ = loops) |
| **Replay Rate** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Number of rewatches per viewer |
| **Engagement Velocity** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Actions in first 30-60 minutes |
| **Shares** | ⭐⭐⭐ | DMs and external shares |
| **Comments** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Quality and length matter |
| **Profile Visits** | ⭐⭐ | Post → Profile conversion |

## ⏱️ Duration Strategy

### Optimal Duration Ranges (2026 Data)

| Duration | Completion Potential | Best For |
|----------|---------------------|----------|
| **7-15 seconds** | 95%+ | Memes, quick hooks, trends |
| **15-30 seconds** | 80-90% | Standard content, tutorials |
| **30-60 seconds** | 60-75% | Stories, detailed content |
| **60-90 seconds** | 40-55% | Educational deep-dives |
| **90+ seconds** | <40% | Rarely recommended |

### The 21-Second Sweet Spot

Data shows **21 seconds** is the ideal duration:
- Long enough for value delivery
- Short enough for high completion
- Perfect for the dopamine cycle

## 🪝 Hook Engineering

### The 1-Second Rule

TikTok users decide to watch or scroll within **1 second**. Hook strategies:

#### Pattern Interrupts
```
"POV: You just discovered..."
"Story time: [dramatic pause]"
"Wait, did you know that..."
"STOP. Before you scroll..."
```

#### Curiosity Gaps
```
"The thing nobody tells you about [X]..."
"I tested [thing] for 30 days. Results?"
"3 things you're doing wrong with..."
"This changed everything I knew about..."
```

#### Controversy Hooks
```
"Unpopular opinion: [statement]"
"I'm about to make people angry..."
"Everyone is lying about..."
```

### Pattern Interrupt Cadence

Every **2-3 seconds**, the viewer's attention needs a refresh:
- Visual change (zoom, cut, transition)
- Audio change (music drop, voice shift)
- Text overlay update
- New information reveal

---

## 🔄 Loop Engineering

### Why Loops Matter

When viewers rewatch, TikTok registers:
- 100%+ completion rate
- Extended watch time
- Higher engagement potential

### Loop Techniques

#### Seamless Loop
End frame connects visually/audibly to start frame.

#### Revelation Loop
"Wait, go back and watch the beginning again..."

#### Missing Detail Loop
Subtle detail in the beginning that's revealed at the end.

#### Question Loop
End with a question that's answered in the beginning.

## 💬 Comment Engineering

### Comment Bait Strategies

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Fill the blank** | "Tell me you're a [X] without telling me..." |
| **Hot takes** | "This is better than [popular thing]" |
| **Debates** | "Am I the only one who thinks..." |
| **Requests** | "Should I make Part 2?" |
| **Challenges** | "Can you do this?" |

### Engagement Quality

Long, genuine comments signal quality content:
- Encourage storytelling
- Ask open questions
- Create relatable scenarios

---

## 🎵 Audio Strategy

### TikTok Sound Ecosystem

| Type | Algorithm Impact | Usage |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| **Trending Sounds** | +++ | Ride the wave, higher discovery |
| **Original Audio** | ++ | Can create new trends |
| **Licensed Music** | + | Limited reach in some regions |
| **Voice Only** | ++ | Intimate, authentic feel |

### Sound Selection Tips

1. Check "Trending" in TikTok sound library
2. Use sounds with 10K-100K videos (not oversaturated)
3. Original sounds can go viral → own the trend
4. Voice tone: energetic, conversational, Gen Z cadence

---

## 📊 Content Lifecycle

### The First 30-60 Minutes

Critical window for algorithm evaluation:
- Initial push to ~200-500 viewers
- Engagement rate determines next batch
- High performance → exponential expansion

### Viral Trajectory

```
Phase 1 (0-1h):    Test batch (~500 views)
Phase 2 (1-4h):    Expansion if metrics good (~5K views)
Phase 3 (4-24h):   Viral push (~50K-500K views)
Phase 4 (24h+):    Sustained or decline
```

### Posting Time (Secondary Factor)

Best times vary by niche, but general peaks:
- 6-9 AM (morning scroll)
- 12-2 PM (lunch break)
- 7-11 PM (evening wind-down)

## #️⃣ Hashtag Strategy

### 2026 Updated Guidelines

| Hashtag Type | Count | Example |
|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Trending** | 1-2 | #fyp, #viral, #foryou |
| **Niche** | 2-3 | #techtok, #learnontiktok |
| **Specific** | 1-2 | #[your-series], #[topic] |
| **Total** | 3-6 | Optimal range |

### Anti-Patterns

❌ Don't use 15+ hashtags (spam signal)
❌ Don't use irrelevant trending hashtags
❌ Don't spam generic-only tags

---

## 🚫 Shadowban Triggers

### Actions That Limit Reach

- Violating community guidelines
- Excessive posting (10+/day)
- Deleting and reposting same content
- Using banned hashtags
- External watermarks (Instagram, YouTube)
- Political/controversial content in some regions

### Recovery Strategies

1. Pause posting for 24-48 hours
2. Post original, high-quality content
3. Engage authentically on other videos
4. Avoid all trigger behaviors

## 📱 Technical Requirements

### Video Specifications

| Spec | Optimal |
|------|---------|
| **Resolution** | 1080x1920 (9:16) |
| **Frame Rate** | 30 FPS |
| **File Format** | MP4 |
| **Text Safe Zone** | Top 150px, Bottom 200px free |

### Native vs Upload

Native (filmed in app) historically got:
- Priority in algorithm
- Higher audio quality sync
- Better trending sound integration

Upload now equal if quality matches.
