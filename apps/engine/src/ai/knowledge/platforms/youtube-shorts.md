## 🎯 Core Algorithm Principles

### How Shorts Differs from TikTok/Reels

YouTube Shorts is unique because it connects to the **broader YouTube ecosystem**:

1. Shorts can drive **channel subscriptions**
2. Shorts appear in **YouTube search**
3. Shorts can funnel to **long-form content**
4. YouTube prioritizes **retention + subscribe signals**

### Primary Ranking Signals (Priority Order)

| Signal | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Viewed vs Swiped** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Did they watch or swipe away? |
| **Watch Time** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Total time spent watching |
| **Retention Rate** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | % watched, loops count |
| **Subscribe Clicks** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | New subs from Short |
| **Engagement** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Likes, comments, shares |
| **Channel History** | ⭐⭐ | Previous content performance |

## ⏱️ Duration Strategy

### Optimal Duration Ranges (2026 Data)

| Duration | Viewed Rate | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **15-30 seconds** | 70%+ | Quick tips, hooks, teasers |
| **30-45 seconds** | 60-70% | Standard content |
| **45-60 seconds** | 50-60% | Detailed tutorials, stories |

### The 30-Second Learning

YouTube data shows **30 seconds** is optimal:
- Enough for value delivery
- High "viewed" (not swiped) rate
- Good for subscriber conversion

---

## 🪝 Hook Engineering

### The "Don't Swipe" Strategy

Shorts users swipe FAST. You need **anti-swipe hooks**:

#### Value Promise Hooks
```
"3 things I wish I knew before [X]"
"The biggest mistake everyone makes with..."
"Here's exactly how I [achieved result]"
"You're doing [thing] wrong. Here's why..."
```

#### Curiosity Hooks
```
"Wait until you see what happens..."
"Nobody believes me when I say this, but..."
"I tested [thing] for 30 days. The results?"
"The secret [industry] doesn't want you to know"
```

#### Authority Hooks
```
"As a [profession] with [X] years experience..."
"I've [achievement]. Here's what I learned..."
"After working with 100+ [clients/projects]..."
```

---

## 📈 Retention Engineering

### The 100%+ Goal

YouTube rewards videos watched multiple times:

#### Progressive Revelation
- Don't give away everything at start
- Build towards a payoff
- Create "I need to see how this ends" tension

#### Information Gaps
- Open a loop at the start
- Close it only at the end
- Make viewers NEED to complete

#### Loop Design
- End frames that connect to beginning
- "Wait, go back and watch that again"
- Revelation that recontextualizes the start

---

## 🔔 Subscribe Optimization

### Why Subs Matter More on Shorts

Unlike TikTok, YouTube Shorts can drive channel growth:
- Subscribe button visible during playback
- New subscribers see your long-form content
- Channel growth = more Shorts reach

### Subscribe CTA Strategies

#### Natural Integration
```
"If you want more [topic], hit subscribe"
"Part 2 is coming - subscribe so you don't miss it"
"I post [frequency] about [topic]"
```

#### Soft Prompts
```
"Follow along for the full series"
"More on my channel"
```

### Subscribe Timing

Best moments for subscribe prompt:
- After delivering value (not before)
- During the "aha moment"
- Before teasing future content

---

## 🔍 YouTube Search Integration

### Shorts in Search

Unlike TikTok/Reels, Shorts appear in YouTube search. Optimize for:

#### Title SEO
```
Good: "How to Edit Videos Like a Pro (3 Tips)"
Bad: "OMG THIS IS INSANE 🤯"
```

#### Description Keywords
```
Include:
- Primary keyword
- Related terms
- Common search phrases
```

#### Tags (Still Matter)
```
- Topic tags
- Related terms
- Broad category
```

---

## 🔗 Long-Form Funnel

### Short → Long Strategy

The unique Shorts advantage: funnel viewers to long-form:

#### Hook Pattern
```
Short: "3 quick tips for [topic]"
CTA: "Full 20-minute breakdown on my channel"
```

#### Teaser Pattern
```
Short: Most interesting clip from long video
CTA: "See the full video - link in bio"
```

#### Series Pattern
```
Short: Part 1 of X
CTA: "Subscribe for all parts + the complete guide"
```

---

## 💬 Comment Strategy

### Comments Drive Algorithm

YouTube values comment engagement:

#### Prompt Techniques
```
"Drop a 🔥 if you learned something"
"What would you add to this list?"
"Hot take - agree or disagree?"
"Comment your [related topic] below"
```

#### Response Strategy
- Reply to early comments
- Ask follow-up questions
- Pin valuable comments

---

## 📊 Content Lifecycle

### The Viewed vs Swiped Metric

Unique to Shorts:
- "Viewed" = watched more than swipe gesture
- "Swiped away" = negative signal
- Target: 70%+ viewed rate

### Shorts Distribution Phases

```
Phase 1 (0-2h):    Test with subscribers + small batch
Phase 2 (2-24h):   Expansion based on viewed rate
Phase 3 (1-7d):    Continued reach or decline
Phase 4 (7-28d):   Content lifecycle (fresher = better)
```

### 28-Day Freshness

YouTube prefers recent content:
- Old Shorts get less push
- Repurposed TikToks age out
- Create native Shorts content
